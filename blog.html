        <h2>My Career journey</h2>
        <p>Graduating from calicut university and not having a job lined up was extreamly demotivating.I had no idea what i wanted to,but i knew i liked working with people.i started to work as a primary teacher for two years.
            after that i decided to move another career in python|Django webdevelopment to set more bright future.A key thing i remind myself is that your network is your networth.Having a supportive and equally ambititious network
            is very important and it will naturally increase your awareness about opportunities.Equally,always be adding new people to your network because you never know when they may come in handy.

        <h2>MY Hobby</h2>
        <p>A hobby gives us pleasure for we do it for the love of the work and not under the compulsion for any monetary or other benefit.Thus ,it is more fulfilling and gives us
            satisfication and joy.My favourite hobby is dancing,driving,learning new things,listening musics etc.....,when learning new things our mind is focussed,it has the capability to be
            more attendive in practical situations of life.As a result,the body mind of such people remain calm.they look at the problem objectively and are better decision makers.
